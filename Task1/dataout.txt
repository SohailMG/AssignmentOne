I WANDERED lonely as a clou
That floats on high over vales and hills
When all at once I saw a crow
A host of golden daffodils
Beside the lake beneath the trees
Fluttering and dancing in the breez

Continuous as the stars that shin
And twinkle on the milky way
They stretched in never ending lin
Along the margin of a bay
Ten thousand saw I at a glanc
Tossing their heads in sprightly danc

The waves beside them danced but they
Out did the sparkling waves in gle
A poet could not but be gay
In such a jocund company
I gazed and gazed but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought

For oft when on my couch I li
In vacant or in pensive moo
They flash upon that inward ey
Which is the bliss of solitud
And then my heart with pleasure fills
And dances with the daffodils
